1. Deal with the visual aesthetic of the site : 
	- space themed sidebars or other fun stuff, cuz minimalism doesnt show off much, even if its very functional
	- more colors!

2. figure out scalability and apply it to all the sites:
	- make sure it works on mobile

3. actual content on the sites (least important part imo)
	- Yeah this one can be added pretty easily later on	
	- If you are up for it, add the dreaded search feature per alien (search the pdf for the appropriate feature)
